# godcr

## Overview
**godcr** is a decred wallet application for Linux, macOS and Windows that provides wallet access and control functionality using [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr/pull/88). It can also interface with [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) via RPC as an alternative to dcrlibwallet. The godcr app can be run in any of the following interface modes:
- Web (web app running on an http server)
- Cli (command-line utility)
- Desktop (native desktop application, currently work in progress)

## Requirements
You can run **godcr** without installing any other software. By default **godcr** uses dcrlibwallet.
To run **godcr** using **dcrwallet** instead of [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr/pull/88), the following is required.
* Download the **decred** release binaries for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases). Check under **Assets**.
* **dcrwallet** requires **dcrd** to work. The decred archive downloaded from the release page contains both binaries.
* After downloading and extracting **dcrd** and **dcrwallet**, [go here](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/cli/cli-installation/) to learn how to setup and run both binaries.

## Installation

### Option 1: Get the binary
**godcr** is not released yet. This doc will be updated with links to download the godcr binary when a release is ready. For now, build from source.

### Option 2: Build from source
* Install Go (minimum supported version is 1.11.4). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://golang.org/doc/install). It is recommended to add $GOPATH/bin to your PATH as part of the installation process.
* Clone this repository. It is conventional to clone to $GOPATH, but not necessary.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr $GOPATH/src/github.com/raedahgroup/godcr
```
* If you clone to $GOPATH, set the `GO111MODULE=on` environment variable when building. On Unix systems, you can add the following line to `~/.bash_profile` to persist the variable
```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```
* `cd` to the cloned project directory and build or install godcr. Building will place the godcr binary in your working directory while install will place the binary in $GOPATH/bin
```bash
$ go build
$ go install
```
* If you cloned the source code to $GOPATH but have not set the GO111MODULE=on environment variable, build/install like this
```bash
$ GO111MODULE=on go build
$ GO111MODULE=on go install
```

## Running godcr
### General usage
You can perform various wallet-related operations by running
```bash
$ godcr [options] <command> [args]
```

### Commands and options
* Use `godcr -h` or `godcr help` to view options, commands and path to the godcr config file
* Some options can only be set in the godcr configuration (godcr.conf) file. Those options are not displayed in the output of `godcr -h`. Edit the config file to view and set those options.
* Use `godcr <command> -h` or `godcr help <command>` to view command args and detailed help information for a command
